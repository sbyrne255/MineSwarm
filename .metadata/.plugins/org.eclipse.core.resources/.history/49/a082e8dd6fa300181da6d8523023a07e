//FEATURE:
	MAYBE CHECK FULL INVENTORY FOR KEY INSTEAD OF JUST HANDS
//BUGS:
	DEALING WITH OVERLAPPING ZONES WILL BE VERY HARD...
//TODO:
	*RANDOM DROPS
		*Configurable items
	*Inventory swaps
		*White list items that can be dropped
	ZONES
		Set mob health/regen [mob spawn event?]
		*Set keys that are dropped
		*set PVP
	Chests plugin
		block chests from sharing items with team (don't allow putting in box, only take out)
		make items randomly spawn into box every few seconds/minutes (scheduler)
	TEAMS
		teams can join randomly as long as they are at start, from there they can TPA 1 time to any player on the team or randomly select a player to TPA to.
		New teams start at spawn
		Leaving a team brings you to spawn
		Creating a team sends everyone back to start
		Teams are limited to 6ish people
		Team owner accepts requests to join, on leave or AFK team owner transfers
		Team score board different from solo
	Leader boards (time/Deaths/KDA-boss/start/enddates/team members or solo/team size) Weeklyboard and all time board
	Class selection
		Give items on command (probably use a command block and MetaData to store CD?)
		Set class in MetaData
		Set team in MetaData
		Revive was originally thought of as team only, but for the time being will be for all users but only medics can save players.
	MetaData
		Use SQLite to save MetaData changes, if it is too slow que up a task list for each item (low priority)
		On Join, load MetaData
		On Leave, save MetaData
	Load a configfile
		*Enable a YML
		Also, create multiple SQL-DBs and provide a scheduled backup (once ever 10 minutes, hold 3 versions?)
		
		
	
		
	
	WHEN PLAYER KILLS ENTITY & ENTITY DROPS KEY, CHECK SQLITE FOR LOCATION, IF IN A ZONE DROP A KEY FOR THAT ZONE (NOT OTHERS)
				/*
				 * WHEN PLAYER KILLS ENTITY, CHECK POS OF PLAYER AGAINST SQLITE SQUARE LOCATIONS, IF THEY ARE BETWEEN POINTS IN DB, DROP THE KEY SPECIFIC TO THAT ROOM, IE
				 * IF POS IS Y = 5, X = 5, Z = 5 AND DB HAS 
				 * START: Y=0, X=0, Y=0 AND
				 * END: Y=10, X=7, Y=15
				 * THEN PLAYER IS BETWEEN 0,0,0 AND 10,7,15, THEREFOR SHOULD GET THE KEY ASSOCIATED WITH IT __IF__ THE MOB IS DROPPING A KEY.
				 */
	SHOW ZONES SHOULD GET BLOCK POS IE: 
		IF ((MIN.X <= PLAYER.X) AND (MAX.X <= PLAYER.X)) AND (MIN.Z <= PLAYER.Z) AND (MAX.Z <= PLAYER.Z) AND (MIN.Y <= PLAYER.Y) AND (MAX.Y <= PLAYER.Y)
