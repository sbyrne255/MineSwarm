//FEATURE:
	MAYBE CHECK FULL INVENTORY FOR KEY INSTEAD OF JUST HANDS
//BUGS:
	DEALING WITH OVERLAPPING ZONES WILL BE VERY HARD...
//TODO:
	*Load a configfile
		*Enable a YML
		*Also, create multiple SQL-DBs and provide a scheduled backup (once ever 10 minutes, hold 3 versions?)//Have not implemented multiple DBs, want to see how this scales.
	*RANDOM DROPS
		*Configurable items
	*Inventory swaps
		*White list items that can be dropped
	*Chests plugin
		*block chests from sharing items with team (don't allow putting in box, only take out)
		*make items randomly spawn into box every few seconds/minutes (scheduler)//Probably should load timing from config, but Mahh
	*Class selection
		*Give items on command (probably use a command block and MetaData to store CD?)
		*Set class in MetaData
	*ZONES
		Set mob health/regen [mob spawn event?]
		*Set keys that are dropped
		*set PVP
		*Show zone you are in
		*TP to zone by name
	TEAMS
		teams can join randomly as long as they are at start, from there they can TPA to any player on the team or randomly select a player to TPA to.
		New teams start at spawn
		Leaving a team brings you to spawn
		Creating a team sends everyone back to start
		Teams are limited to 6ish people
		Team owner accepts requests to join, on leave or AFK team owner transfers
		Team score board different from solo
		Look into spectral glow to team mates
	Leader boards (time/Deaths/KDA-boss/start/enddates/team members or solo/team size) Weeklyboard and all time board
		Meta saves:
			Number of mobs killed (by type) [Maybe JSON?] [some sort of DB]
			Time from taking first kit to completion [Meta]//How to signal game end...
			*Number of times downed [Meta]
			*Number of times reviving [Meta]
			*Number of times revived [Meta]
			*Number of times died [Meta]
			*Kit type [Meta]
			*Total damage delt to mobs (on damage event, add damage taken/given) [Meta]
			*Total damage taken [Meta]
			&Team members [Meta]
			&Team size [Meta]
			
			
	ALSO ADD DOOR TO TELL LEVEL WHEN CLICKING ON IT WITH A KEY THAT DOESN'T OPEN IT!
			
	MetaData
		Use SQLite to save MetaData changes, if it is too slow que up a task list for each item (low priority)
		On Join, load MetaData
		On Leave, save MetaData
		
		
SCHEDULE TIMER, EVERY 20s CONFIGURSABE check all MOBSPAWNERS (CUSTOM SET) in DB (NEW DB, OR AT LEAST NEW TABLE) check area if there are more than X number of zombies (configurable) spawn more
if there is less than X in a XYZ radius (configurable) don't spawn any.
