//FEATURE:
	MAYBE CHECK FULL INVENTORY FOR KEY INSTEAD OF JUST HANDS
//BUGS:
	DEALING WITH OVERLAPPING ZONES WILL BE VERY HARD...
	IF BOTH ITEMS IN HAND (MAIN AND OFF HAND) HAVE ITEMS WITH META, I CURRENTLY ONLY CHECK MAINHAND, I NEED TO UPDATE THIS TO CHECK BOTH HANDS AND REMOVE 1 FROM THE HAND THAT MATCHES.
//TODO:
	WHEN PLAYER KILLS ENTITY & ENTITY DROPS KEY, CHECK SQLITE FOR LOCATION, IF IN A ZONE DROP A KEY FOR THAT ZONE (NOT OTHERS)
				/*
				 * WHEN PLAYER KILLS ENTITY, CHECK POS OF PLAYER AGAINST SQLITE SQUARE LOCATIONS, IF THEY ARE BETWEEN POINTS IN DB, DROP THE KEY SPECIFIC TO THAT ROOM, IE
				 * IF POS IS Y = 5, X = 5, Z = 5 AND DB HAS 
				 * START: Y=0, X=0, Y=0 AND
				 * END: Y=10, X=7, Y=15
				 * THEN PLAYER IS BETWEEN 0,0,0 AND 10,7,15, THEREFOR SHOULD GET THE KEY ASSOCIATED WITH IT __IF__ THE MOB IS DROPPING A KEY.

	SHOW ZONES SHOULD GET BLOCK POS IE: 
		IF ((MIN.X <= PLAYER.X) AND (MAX.X <= PLAYER.X)) AND (MIN.Z <= PLAYER.Z) AND (MAX.Z <= PLAYER.Z) AND (MIN.Y <= PLAYER.Y) AND (MAX.Y <= PLAYER.Y)
