//FEATURE:
	MAYBE CHECK FULL INVENTORY FOR KEY INSTEAD OF JUST HANDS
//BUGS:
	DEALING WITH OVERLAPPING ZONES WILL BE VERY HARD...
//TODO:
	ZONES
		Set mob health/regen
		Set keys that are dropped
		set PVP
	RANDOM DROPS
		Configurable items
		Change chances or implement special items in zones (use zone friendly names from config?)
	Inventory swaps
		White list items that can be dropped
	TEAMS
		teams can join randomly as long as they are at start, from there they can TPA 1 time to any player on the team or randomly select a player to TPA to.
		New teams start at spawn
		Leaving a team brings you to spawn
		Creating a team sends everyone back to start
		Teams are limited to 6ish people
		Team owner accepts requests to join, on leave or AFK team owner transfers
		Team score board different from solo
	Leader boards (time/Deaths/KDA-boss/start/enddates/team members or solo/team size)
		
	
	WHEN PLAYER KILLS ENTITY & ENTITY DROPS KEY, CHECK SQLITE FOR LOCATION, IF IN A ZONE DROP A KEY FOR THAT ZONE (NOT OTHERS)
				/*
				 * WHEN PLAYER KILLS ENTITY, CHECK POS OF PLAYER AGAINST SQLITE SQUARE LOCATIONS, IF THEY ARE BETWEEN POINTS IN DB, DROP THE KEY SPECIFIC TO THAT ROOM, IE
				 * IF POS IS Y = 5, X = 5, Z = 5 AND DB HAS 
				 * START: Y=0, X=0, Y=0 AND
				 * END: Y=10, X=7, Y=15
				 * THEN PLAYER IS BETWEEN 0,0,0 AND 10,7,15, THEREFOR SHOULD GET THE KEY ASSOCIATED WITH IT __IF__ THE MOB IS DROPPING A KEY.

	SHOW ZONES SHOULD GET BLOCK POS IE: 
		IF ((MIN.X <= PLAYER.X) AND (MAX.X <= PLAYER.X)) AND (MIN.Z <= PLAYER.Z) AND (MAX.Z <= PLAYER.Z) AND (MIN.Y <= PLAYER.Y) AND (MAX.Y <= PLAYER.Y)
