				 * WHEN PLAYER KILLS ENTITY, CHECK POS OF PLAYER AGAINST SQLITE SQUARE LOCATIONS, IF THEY ARE BETWEEN POINTS IN DB, DROP THE KEY SPECIFIC TO THAT ROOM, IE
				 * IF POS IS Y = 5, X = 5, Z = 5 AND DB HAS 
				 * START: Y=0, X=0, Y=0 AND
				 * END: Y=10, X=7, Y=15
				 * THEN PLAYER IS BETWEEN 0,0,0 AND 10,7,15, THEREFOR SHOULD GET THE KEY ASSOCIATED WITH IT __IF__ THE MOB IS DROPPING A KEY.
				 *
				 * using a custom tool (hoe?) left click block POS1, right click block POS 2, enter height statically?
				 * command would be something like: /mineswarm mark //enables hoe
				 * *hits 2 blocks, 1 left, 1 right using player meta data
				 * /mineswarm setzone ID bottom top
				 * /mineswarm showzone ID (no arg = zone currently in)
