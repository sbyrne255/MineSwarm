//FEATURE:
	MAYBE CHECK FULL INVENTORY FOR KEY INSTEAD OF JUST HANDS
//BUGS:
	
//TODO:
	*Load a configfile
		*Enable a YML
		*Also, create multiple SQL-DBs and provide a scheduled backup (once ever 10 minutes, hold 3 versions?)//Have not implemented multiple DBs, want to see how this scales.
	*RANDOM DROPS
		*Configurable items
	*Inventory swaps
		*White list items that can be dropped
	*Chests plugin
		*block chests from sharing items with team (don't allow putting in box, only take out)
		*make items randomly spawn into box every few seconds/minutes (scheduler)//Probably should load timing from config, but Mahh
	*Class selection
		*Give items on command (probably use a command block and MetaData to store CD?)
		*Set class in MetaData
	*ZONES
		*Set keys that are dropped
		*set PVP
		*Show zone you are in
		*TP to zone by name
	*MetaData
		*Use SQLite to save MetaData changes, if it is too slow que up a task list for each item (low priority)
		*On Join, load MetaData
		*On Leave, save MetaData
	*TEAMS
		*AFK/Leaving kicks you from own spot...//Essentials will handle the AFK kicks, on leave/onkick event will be the action.
		*New teams start at spawn
		*Leaving a team brings you to spawn
		*Creating a team sends everyone back to start
		*Teams are limited to 6ish people
		*On downed team-mate message all team members...
		*teams can join randomly as long as they are at start, from there they can TPA to any player on the team or randomly select a player to TPA to.
		^NIXED FOR THE TIME BEING. Teams have team name above head like so: https://bukkit.org/threads/tutorial-scoreboards-teams-with-the-bukkit-api.139655/
			//On team leave/join GET list of team mates, send as param to update scoreboard.
		*Team owner accepts requests to join, on leave or AFK team owner transfers
			*Create Team [Name]
			*Join Team [Name]
			*Delete Team [Name] //leave and make someone else the owner
			*Kick Team member [Player name]
			*TPA to team (massive cooldowns) [Player]
			*Team score board different from solo *Search by team_size > 1
		^NIXED BECAUSE NNMPACKETS BREAK ON EACH UPDATE, DON'T WANNA MAINTAIN THAT. Look into spectral glow to team mates// Answer about half way down with protolib: https://bukkit.org/threads/glowing-for-one-person.446790/
	Leader boards (time/Deaths/KD/start/enddates/team members or solo/team size) Weeklyboard and all time board
